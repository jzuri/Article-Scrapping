Why Alex Murdaugh’s hearing on clerk's alleged jury tampering likely won’t lead to a new trial
Murdaugh's attorneys must meet a pretty high burden of proof if they hope to get a new trial for the disgraced South Carolina lawyer.

Alex Murdaugh's
 chances of a 
new murder trial
 hinge on whether his lawyers can clear a high burden of proof to show that the clerk of court in 
his high-profile trial
 last year improperly influenced jurors to convict him. 
Murdaugh's lawyers had 
asked for a new trial 
for their client in September over allegations that Rebecca Hill, the Colleton County clerk of court at his trial, 
pressured jurors into finding him guilty
 of murdering his wife and younger son so that she could "secure for herself a book deal and media appearances that would not happen in the event of a mistrial."
Hill did self-publish a book about the trial that she co-wrote with journalist Neil Gordon, but sales were halted in December after she admitted to plagiarizing sections from a BBC reporter’s work.
She 
denied
 allegations of jury tampering in a sworn statement in November, and South Carolina prosecutors advised a judge against holding a hearing. Hill is also currently the focus of
 two separate criminal investigations
 by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division: one into alleged interactions with jurors during Murdaugh's trial, and another into alleged misuse of public funds. She has 
denied any wrongdoing
 and has not been charged. 
At a procedural pre-hearing Tuesday, Murdaugh's chances of a new murder trial appeared to
 
dim after a judge ruled that his lawyers must not only prove that Hill improperly influenced the jury, but also that she did so with prejudice against Murdaugh.
Retired South Carolina Supreme Court Justice Jean Toal also barred Murdaugh's lawyers from raising questions about Hill's plagiarism and alleged misuse of public money.
Toal said the case is about Hill and the jurors. “This is not the trial of Mrs. Hill,” Toal said. "This is not the time to explore every mistake or incorrect statement or false statement ever made by this witness."
The hearing is set to begin Jan. 29 and is likely to include testimony from Hill and the 12 jurors who convicted Murdaugh.

Fans sue Madonna for starting her concert two hours late
The late start to the concert affected fans who “had to get up early to go to work and/or take care of their family responsibilities the next day,” the lawsuit claims.

Madonna
 is being sued by two fans who are hung up on the late start to her concert in New York City last month.
Michael Fellows of Brooklyn and Jonathan Hadden of the Bronx filed a 
lawsuit
 against the “Material Girl” singer in Brooklyn federal court, alleging that they were not informed that the Dec. 13 show on her “Celebration Tour” would start later than the 8:30 p.m. scheduled time.
According to the suit, which is seeking class action status, the 65-year-old pop star took the stage at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn between 10:45 and 11 p.m., and the performance lasted past 1 a.m.
Concertgoers struggled with limited and more expensive transportation options leaving the venue after the show, the lawsuit alleges, adding that many people who went to see Madonna perform on a weeknight — as Hadden and Fellows did — “had to get up early to go to work and/or take care of their family responsibilities the next day.”
Had they known the concerts would start and end so late, they would not have paid for their tickets, the lawsuit said. (Fellows paid $155.90 for one ticket, and Hadden paid $292.50 for two, according to the suit.)
The defendants — including Live Nation, the organizer, and the Barclays Center — “engaged in unconscionable, unfair, and/or deceptive trade practices by offering to the public Concerts that were promised to begin at 8:30 p.m., knowing that Madonna would most certainly not take the stage at the advertised start time,” the lawsuit stated. (NBC News 
reached out to the defendants
 on Thursday and did not receive a response.)
Hadden and Fellows allege that Madonna’s late concert starts are part of a pattern, citing similarly late start times in her past tours. Madonna was sued by a fan for starting her concert later than scheduled in 2019, too, though that lawsuit was quickly dropped, 
ABC News
 reported. Another lawsuit in 2020 — also in New York, also over a two-hour delay — was settled and voluntarily dismissed.
The pop star had 
postponed
 the start of her “Celebration Tour” from June to October due to a bacterial infection. Tickets 
sold out
 quickly upon release, and current verified resale tickets for her concert at Madison Square Garden cost upward of $199 on Ticketmaster.

Wayne LaPierre resigns as NRA CEO after more than 30 years
LaPierre's resignation comes days before the start of a civil corruption trial filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James.
Jan. 5, 2024, 8:51 PM UTC

Clarissa-Jan Lim
Ahead of a potentially damaging 
corruption trial
, Wayne LaPierre announced Friday that he's stepping down from his role as the CEO of the 
National Rifle Association
 for health reasons. 
“With pride in all that we have accomplished, I am announcing my resignation from the NRA,” LaPierre said in a 
statement
. “I’ve been a card-carrying member of this organization for most of my adult life, and I will never stop supporting the NRA and its fight to defend Second Amendment freedom."
Head of the country’s leading gun rights lobbying group 
since 1991
, LaPierre's resignation marks the end of an influential 30-plus-year reign. But while the NRA's board of directors voted to re-elect LaPierre in 2022, the group has been plagued recently by worsening finances, declining membership numbers and steep legal bills. He had survived 
calls for his resignation 
in the past. 
The NRA's statement cited health reasons for LaPierre's departure. The timing, however, is notable: He is due to stand trial Monday in a New York civil corruption case in which he and other executives are accused of using the organization 
as a "personal piggy bank." 
The 
lawsuit
, which New York Attorney General Letitia James 
filed in 2020
, accuses LaPierre and other top NRA officials of misusing the nonprofit's money to fund lavish personal lifestyles. 
James alleges that LaPierre spent millions of dollars of the NRA's charitable assets on "private plane trips for himself and his family," including to the Bahamas. He also allegedly accepted gifts from NRA vendors, including the use of a 107-foot yacht and complimentary African safaris.
LaPierre is named as an individual defendant, which means he will still have to testify before a jury, despite his resignation.

Fox News airs absurd conspiracy theory that Taylor Swift is a Pentagon asset
Host Jesse Watters, who often uses a "just asking questions" tactic to amplify outlandish false claims to viewers, admitted he had "no evidence" for the Swift conspiracy theory.

A bizarre conspiracy theory about Taylor Swift aired on Fox News' "Jesse Watters Primetime" on Tuesday, with host Watters suggesting that Swift is a 
Pentagon psy-op asset
 who is using her fan base to drum up support for President Joe Biden. 
Let's preface this with Watters' own words, because in between throwing out all sorts of preposterous claims, he straight-up admits that the entire premise is pure speculation. “So is Swift a front for a covert political agenda?” Watters asks. “‘Primetime’ obviously has no evidence — if we did, we’d share it. But we’re curious.”
Watters first suggests that Swift's success has something to do with her being a Pentagon asset. 
"I like her music. She's all right, but I mean, have you ever wondered how or why she blew up like this?" Watters asks. "Well, around four years ago, the Pentagon psychological operations unit floated turning Taylor Swift into an asset during a NATO meeting. What kind of asset? A psy-op of combating online misinformation."
He then plays a clip of a 
presentation
 at the 2019 International Conference on Cyber Conflict, an annual NATO conference, in which the presenter talks about how social influence can lead to behavior change, using Swift as an example of someone with influence online. 
Except the person speaking was not a Pentagon employee, as Watters claimed; 
Mediaite
 identified her as Alicia Bargar, who at the time was a data scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. (Bargar did not respond to MSNBC's request for comment.) 
Mediaite also traced the framing of this clip to Michael Benz, a former Trump State Department official who posted it on X early Monday. 
NBC News
 revealed in October that Benz previously ran an alt-right account that engaged with white nationalists and shared racist conspiracy theories like the "great replacement theory."
In his segment, Watters asks if Swift was "a front for a covert political agenda." "Because when she posted a link to the Vote.org, hundreds of thousands of young Taylor Swift fans all of a sudden registered to vote," he says. "I wonder who got to her from the White House, or from wherever."
A Defense Department spokesperson 
dismissed
 the conspiracy theory at a briefing on Wednesday. The CEO of Vote.org, Andrea Hailey, also responded on Tuesday night, 
writing on X
 that the organization's partnership with Swift is "not a psy-op or a Pentagon asset."
So how did a ridiculous conspiracy theory that could have easily been disproven get airtime on a highly rated cable show? 
Just his like predecessor 
Tucker Carlson
, Watters uses a "just asking questions" approach to 
amplify outlandish false claims
 to millions of viewers, night after night. It's his show's bread and butter, and viewers are 
insatiably hungry
 for it.

Former GOP rep caught in a bizarre scandal about food pictures
May all political scandals this year be as low stakes — and weird — as "Grubgate."
Jan. 4, 2024, 2:28 PM UTC

Clarissa-Jan Lim
Texas Republican Mayra Flores, a former member of Congress who is running to retake her old seat, was exposed in a curious kerfuffle in which she seems to have nicked photos of Mexican food from other social media accounts and posted them as her own.
Dubbed "Grubgate," the bizarre controversy came to light when an X user shared a screenshot of a photo that Flores recently posted with the caption, "The Ranch life with family is the best," next to a 2022 post from a "Visit Guyana" Facebook account that used the same photo. 
A conservative website, 
Current Revolt
, unearthed more instances in which Flores appears to have passed off photos from other accounts as her own. 
The Texas Tribune
 also found additional photos on Flores' Instagram that seem to have been taken from other social media accounts.
Under one photo she reposted, initially 
shared
 online by a Spanish-language magazine in 2021, Flores wrote: "As a proud Latina who knows how to cook, homemade Mexican food tastes better from a gas stove" — apparently in reference to the recent 
outrage du jour 
over gas stoves
.
Flores became the first Mexican-born member of Congress when she was 
elected to the U.S. House
 in a special election in June 2022. She was 
ousted in November
 that year by a Democrat, Rep. Vincente Gonzalez. 
She launched a bid for her old seat in June 2023. 
Granted, the stakes here are very low, and unlike another scandal involving an 
also-former member of Congress
, no campaign funds appear to have been misused in the making of this one. 
Flores herself seemed reluctant to delve into it. She told the Tribune in a text message that the gas stove photo reminded her of her childhood and that she hadn't "intended to mislead” anyone. 
She added that she had
 
deleted her latest post to "clear up any confusion," but when the Tribune asked for further details, she reportedly told the newspaper to focus on "the border crisis."
